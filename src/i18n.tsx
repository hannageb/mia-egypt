It is one of those candlesticks characterized by a tapering cylindrical base, a long neck and a conical candle groove. The body and neck are decorated with an epigraphic band mentioning the name and titles of sultan QƒÅytbƒÅy. It should be noticed that the first letters of the words take the shape of rising criss-crossing flames, providing them with a sense of livelihood and mobility. Groups of epigraphic blazons of sultan QƒÅytbƒÅy intermingle with the text. The central disk in the body bears an inscription which says :‚Äúthis was endowed to the holly shrine by our lord, the sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Abul-Nasr QƒÅytbƒÅy in the year 880AH in the holy month of Ramadan",
                horse_saddle_desc: "This saddle is a living proof of the importance of compassion in Islam. In this vein, Islamic Art has produced numerous other artifacts designed to protect and take care of different animals. So, despite of its being a horse saddle made merely to cover a horse's back, the artisan who made it toiled at decorating it with velvet, silk and silver threads. This demonstrates, beyond any doubt, the philosophy of beauty, mercy and compassion to living creatures of the Islamic Civilization.", 
                stucco_frame_desc: "This unique example was brought from the Madrasah of Ayyubid Sultan al-KƒÅmil (622AH/1225AD), that was overlooking al-Mu‚Äôizz street at that time. The window has a border frame decorated with Kufic writings and interlaced vegetal motifs.",
                shard_desc: "This fragment depicts what is believed by some to be the portrait of Jesus Christ, with a beard and long hair, carrying a book ,thought to be the Bible, bestowing his blessings with his right hand. His two fingers symbolize the dual nature of Jesus, and some researchers believe that his other three fingers symbolize the two letters Alpha and Omega, as mentioned in the Apocalypse of St.John. This scene is repeated in Coptic Art in the wall paintings of the monastery of Bawƒ´t, in Upper Egypt, 5th century AD, which reflects the religious tolerance towards non-Muslims in the Fatimid period.",
                kohl_container_desc: "Islam considers cleanliness, proper demeanor and good looks as signs of faith. This led to the popularity of cosmetic tools in Islamic Art, such as perfume sprinklers, kohl containers, combs and mirrors.",

                copper_table_desc:"This kind of table was commonly called a dinner chair by some scholars of Islamic Art, whereas it was most probably used as a Quran holder in the mosques or for carrying the candlesticks during prayer time on both sides of the Mi·∏•rƒÅb. It could have also been used for holding personal accessories. The table takes the shape of a hexagonal prism decorated with vegetal, geometric, animal, and epigraphic motifs quoting Quranic and invocational phrases. A small double-leafed door opens up on one of its sides and is decorated with vegetal elements. The legs of the table are connected with six supports bearing the name of the artisan who made it ‚ÄúMu·∏•ammad ibn Sunqur al BughdƒÅdi al Sankari and the date of manufacturing 728 AH/327-1328 AD.

                dish_desc: "Ottoman ceramic products ranged from dishes, bowls, ewers and goblets, to perfume bottles, vases, pilgrimage flasks, and lamp suspension eggs. Ottoman ceramics reached high levels of precision and perfection. They became very popular on the European markets. The group from which this specimen derives is attributed to several Turkish cities such as Iznik, K√ºtahya, and Gallipoli (Canakkale). The artifacts in this group are decorated with under glaze polychromic motifs on white slip depicting tulips, cloves, and lancelet leaves. The vegetal motifs have played a vital role in the Ottoman Arts, and were frequently utilized on the Ottoman artistic products. Some of these decorations had a symbolic significance to the Ottomans. European influences are also clear in the decoration of these items such as some Roman influence which is a mixture of stylized Islamic foliate ornaments applied on an European pattern",

This is a scientific manuscript copied in Turkey and ornamented with scenes of plants, explaining their medical benefits, and their usage in curing. Given that it is a scientific manuscript, the copier didn‚Äôt give sufficient care to make borders to its pages; but rather focused on drawing the herbs and specify their medical usage.",
